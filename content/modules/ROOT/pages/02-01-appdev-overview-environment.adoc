= AppDev - Lab Overview, Environment, and Logins

== Overview

In this lab each user will be exposed to an _art of the possible approach_ for how separate application services that together create an Edge based shopping application can operationalize deployed AI/ML models and apply business logic to solve business needs -- identifying and pricing a new product offering in a store or kiosk.

Each user will perform the following tasks:

* Log into OpenShift Console and review their existing AppDev (edge application) project
* Review and test the Model Serving component against an existing image detection model.
* Review and test the Red Hat Camel Quarkus based shopping application.
* Initiate a pipeline run for the training, building, and deployment of a new image detection model.
* Try out the new model through the shopping application
* (Optional) Review, modify, and test the Red Hat CamelK pricing engine service.


Each user will have all their required services available in their own OpenShift projects.

* Edge Application Project:  *{user}-lab2-edge*
* Data Science and Piplelines Project: *{user}-lab2-ds*

== Shopping Application Components

In our "Art of the Possible" scenario for this lab, we are using an "edge" application to call the deployed image detection model. This application is referred to as the *Shopping Application* and is made up of the following services:


* *The _Shopping GUI_* : This is the OpenShift deployment called  *shopper*. It is a Red Hat Camel Quarkus application that provides a GUI for shoppers to take pictures or load pictures of items they want to purchase.  The web based frontend can run on a computer or on phone web browsers.  This service works with the other services on the edge to identify the product and offer a price back to the shopper.
* *The _Model Server_* : This is the Openshift deployment called *tf-server* :  It is a containerized TensorFlow Serving engine.  In this Lab we are using TensorFlow as our AI framework to build and run models. OpenShift AI supports many different frameworks and approaches. _This lab chose an approach that allows for smaller footprint model serving that can work disconnected from a central model server._ The *tf-service* calls a deployed model that was pushed out to a production S3 Bucket (Minio) on the "Edge".  This service provides *shopper* with image detection inferencing.
* *The _Pricing Engine_* : This is the OpenShift deployment called *price-engine* :  It is a Red Hat CamelK service that is called by shopper to look up pricing for identified product pictures/images. Services like this provide the business logic for making decisons based upon what inferences models make.
* *IoT Message Broker* : Each user edge project will have a service called *broker-amq*, which is an instance of Red Hat AMQ Broker running MQTT protocol. This demo can be ramped up into many different configurations and topologies. In many true edge scenarios a message broker running MQTT protocol provides a powerful lightweight approach for IoT scenarios. (MQTT is designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport that is ideal for connecting remote devices with a small code footprint and minimal network bandwidth.)
* *Edge Based S3 Data Services* : Each Edge project has its own compact Minio S3 storage capability deployed with the name *minio* : This is an S3 storage system where you can publish your models.  *tf-server* will load and use new and updated models as they are moved into the Edge production S3 bucket.

NOTE: You’ll find in the Edge project other systems also deployed, but we won’t dive into them as they are of less importance to the main story. Some mentions will be done to them when the context is relevant.

=== Comments on Topology of the Lab
For purposes of supporting a large lab exercise the lab developers have simplified the layout.  Normally the "Edge" tier running the above services would be running on an edge device running on something like Red Hat Device Edge with MicroShift, or Red Hat Single Node Openshift.  The edge (kiosk, store, remote location) would have it's own S3 storage that receives new models and updated models from an MLOps lifecycle that supports GitOps approaches. The edge environment would be either disconnected or partially connected to a central data center or cloud environment where the model building, training, and monitoring occurs. The lab presenters will cover explanations and approaches for more real-world topologies.


=== Red Hat OpenShift DevSpaces
An important Development capability, Red Hat *DevSpaces* has been included with the installation for each user.  DevSpaces provides a powerful Red Hat OpenShift hosted IDE, and its server component runs as a container inside OpenShift. It provides an inner loop development experience for the developer as part of an overall CI/CD approach. The DevSpaces IDE runs in a web browser providing users with Visual Studio Code as its default visual environment.  Each user in this lab has their own DevSpaces instance. The Optional CamelK section at the end of this lab will take advantage of this capability.

=== User Credentials

Each person attending this lab will have a unique user account in which to do their work.

If you are using the customized version of the instructions, the information below will render properly. If not, you will see placeholder values instead.

* Your account id: `{user}`
* Your password: `{password}`

=== Log into the OpenShift Console
In a new window or tab, open the following URL and log into OpenShift:

* The Red Hat OpenShift Console login page:
** https://console-openshift-console.apps.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/[https://console-openshift-console.apps.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/]

* Enter your credentials as detailed above (as detailed above)

* After you authenticate, you should be taken into your {user}-lab2-edge project, and the result should look like:
** You need to ensure you are in developer view, and have clicked on the Topology view option as indicated in the screenshot below.
